# pandas-challenge

In this challenge, I used Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to create a report that summarizes keymetrics for schools across various districts and schools.

First, I created a district summary that ultimately showed the % of students passing math and reading across districts

Then, I went a layer deeper and created a summary by school and type of school to also show % of schools passing math and reading. 

I was also able to provide the top 5 highest and bottom 5 lowest performing schools by overall passing rates across both math and reading

Breaking it down a layer deeper, I provided the average math and reading scores by grade and also provided a summary of scores based on the per capita budget per school.
